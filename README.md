#Capstone Project for ALX Front End Dev.

This project is about creation of a amusic application by the use of React and Vite. The project has installed dependencies which as well include react-router-dom, typesript  and npm.

The project can be able to play songs by the use of the audioRef tag and as well it is able to toggle around songs.

The project is still in continuation to make it complete and to be able to load locally released songs.

Thank you.
